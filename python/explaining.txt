Code basically imports all thge libraries needed.
It then loads the image from the path then sizes the image into the dimesions we're working with (line 6-7)
Splits the image into the RGB respectively, normalises the values to binary and opens a file in write mode.
Writes the red then blue and then green channels into the array split by a lowercase "n" (separator).
Sets the path to downloads, calls a function to process the image, normalise and etc and then finally inserts RGB values to the file and saves it.
